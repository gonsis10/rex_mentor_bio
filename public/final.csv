Fruit color is a key quality characteristic as it drives consumer preference and market acceptability. The red color of raspberries is conferred by anthocyanins. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes involved in color determination and anthocyanin biosynthesis have been previously reported. However, the vast majority of the studies was based on linkage analysis from the same mapping population, resulting in low-resolution maps and limiting the applications to the population studied. To date, there are still no molecular markers to aid raspberry selection for desired fruit color. Aroma volatiles are also critical to determine fruit preference and to ensure repeat purchase of raspberries. Nearly 300 volatile organic compounds have been detected in raspberries, with composition and abundance varying depending on the genotype, pre- and post-harvest factors. Knowledge about the genetic determinants underlying aroma compounds in raspberry is very scarce and limited to one QTL mapping study.

Particularly in people with genetic immune conditions, who face a higher risk of developing lung disease. Currently, lung health is assessed using breathing tests and imaging tools like chest X-rays or CT scans. While valuable, these methods have important limitations: CT scans expose patients to repeated radiation, and standard lung function tests often miss early signs of disease, especially in children.

To overcome these challenges, I study two emerging techniques that I hope will provide a more precise and radiation-free alternative for evaluating lung health. The first is the multiple breath washout (MBW) test, which can detect early, subtle changes in how air ventilates the lungs. The second is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can be used to produce high-resolution images without radiation, as well as use inhaled gases to visualize different aspects of lung function.

By applying these tools to individuals with inborn errors of immunity, my goal is to detect lung disease earlier, track it more accurately, and gain new insights into how immune system dysfunction contributes to lung damage over time.","I would like to work collaboratively with my mentees to explore research topics that align with both their interests and my areas of expertise. My goal is to guide them through identifying meaningful research questions and support them in designing and carrying out a small scale project. Given the multidisciplinary nature of my research, I can offer mentorship in both technical domains (e.g. lung function testing and medical imaging) and clinical content areas (e.g. immunologic dysregulation). I hope to foster curiosity, build some simple technical skills, and encourage independent thinking.

One potential project would investigate the effects of backpack loading and posture on pulmonary function. Using accessible techniques such as spirometry and oscillometry, students would measure lung function under varying conditions (e.g., sitting vs. standing, with and without a loaded backpack) to assess how posture and/or external loading influence respiratory mechanics. A hands on study of this kind would provide experience with clinical tests, underscore their real-world relevance in contexts like occupational health, and generate potentially novel data in a somewhat under explored area of respiratory research.

Alternatively, students who are interested in working with larger datasets can explore existing data from imaging and lung function registries. This would involve retrospective research (looking back at already collected data) to find patterns between what we see in medical images and how the lungs are functioning in different health conditions.

Both theoretical projects, I think, could be made feasible within a reasonable timeline, with early stages focused on topic selection and design, followed by data collection or synthesis, and concluding with interpretation and presentation of findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30918023/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31699844/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244852/,,Yes,Yes,Yes

Much of our work involves using scRNA-seq to dissect cellular heterogeneity, uncover disease mechanisms, and identify clinically relevant biomarkers.
My specific interest lies in applying deep learning methods to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of scRNA-seq analysis. I aim to develop models that can extract novel biological insights.

I work on developing PINNs for applications in gravitational physics, where traditional numerical methods can be computationally intensive or limited by sparse data. One of my key interests is using PINNs not just to solve differential equations, but also to perform inverse modeling—that is, estimating hidden physical parameters (such as mass, energy distribution, or source location) directly from observational data. This approach has the potential to enhance how we model gravitational systems, from Newtonian potentials to aspects of general relativity, and could eventually be applied to areas like gravitational wave signal reconstruction. I’m particularly interested in how these ML models generalize under noisy or incomplete data, and how they can complement existing simulation pipelines. Through this project, I aim to guide an undergraduate researcher through building and training a PINN on a simplified gravitational system, with the goal of recovering underlying physical parameters—offering both practical ML experience and a window into real-world physics problems.","In this project, we will explore how machine learning can be combined with physics to model gravitational systems and recover hidden physical parameters from data. Specifically, we will build a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to learn solutions to gravitational field equations, and then use this model to perform parameter estimation—a process that allows us to infer unknown quantities such as mass or energy distribution directly from observations.

We will start with a well-understood, simplified system: Newtonian gravity in one or two dimensions. Using synthetic data that simulates observations of a gravitational field or orbital motion, the student will train a PINN to learn the gravitational potential or force field. The PINN will be guided not only by the data but also by the known differential equations that govern gravity. Once the forward model is working, we’ll move to the inverse problem: can the neural network recover the mass or other physical parameters used to generate the data?

The project will be divided into three stages:
	1.	Foundations & Forward Modeling (Weeks 1–4): The student will learn about PINNs, differential equations in physics, and PyTorch (or a similar ML framework). They will implement a PINN to solve a simple gravitational problem with known solutions.
	2.	Inverse Problem & Parameter Estimation (Weeks 5–8): The student will adapt their PINN to estimate unknown physical parameters from data. This involves modifying the network structure or loss function to include trainable physical quantities.
	3.	Extension & Evaluation (Weeks 9–12): Depending on progress, we will explore further challenges—adding noise to simulate real measurements, increasing dimensionality, or incorporating uncertainty estimation into the model.

This project is designed to be both technically enriching and scientifically meaningful. The student will gain hands-on experience with machine learning, numerical methods, and scientific computing, while also deepening their understanding of classical physics and how modern tools can be used to investigate age-old problems. There’s also room for creativity and originality—if the student is motivated, we can explore more advanced systems or test how well the PINN generalizes to new conditions.

In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, only about 40% of patients benefit from chemotherapy given before surgery, yet all patients are currently exposed to its side effects. To address this, I use artificial intelligence and advanced imaging techniques to study tumor samples in detail. By analyzing digital pathology slides and combining them with molecular and immune information, I aim to identify patterns that can tell us early on who is likely to benefit.

I also study how the immune system interacts with tumors, using methods that allow us to “map” the tumor microenvironment at the single-cell level. This helps reveal how treatment reshapes the tumor and its surroundings, and why some patients respond while others do not. Alongside this, I build computer models that combine different kinds of data—such as images, gene activity, and clinical features—to improve prediction accuracy.

Ultimately, the goal of my work is to discover reliable biomarkers that can guide treatment decisions, reduce unnecessary side effects, and move toward a future where cancer therapy is more precise, personalized, and effective.","For a mentee project, I would like to design a study focused on predicting molecular subtypes of cancer from histopathology images using artificial intelligence (AI). Molecular subtypes—such as basal and luminal subtypes in bladder cancer—are usually identified through costly gene expression assays. If we can instead predict them directly from routine pathology slides, this could transform diagnosis and guide therapy more efficiently.

The project would begin with a background phase (month 1), where mentees learn the clinical and biological importance of molecular subtyping and why histology might capture these differences. This will include short readings, group discussions, and exposure to how subtypes affect treatment decisions.

Next, mentees would enter a data and coding phase (months 2–3). They would work with publicly available datasets (e.g., TCGA), learning how to handle large digital pathology slides, extract image patches, and link them to molecular labels. During this stage, mentees would be introduced to Python programming basics, data handling with pandas and numpy, and visualization with matplotlib. The emphasis is on gaining confidence with data and coding through simple, hands-on tasks.

The following machine learning phase (months 4–5) would build on these skills. Mentees would learn about key ML concepts—training vs. testing, overfitting, cross-validation—and then apply them using established frameworks. They would start with simple models (logistic regression, random forests) before progressing to deep learning methods tailored for pathology, such as multiple-instance learning (MIL). This gradual progression ensures they understand the foundations before tackling complex models.

Finally, in the analysis and interpretation phase (month 6), mentees would evaluate model performance, generate interpretability maps to highlight predictive tumor regions, and discuss the biological plausibility of their findings. The project would conclude with a written summary or poster, encouraging mentees to practice scientific communication.

Throughout, the emphasis would be on mentorship and skill-building: learning to think critically about data, gaining coding literacy, and understanding the bridge between biology and AI. Even if the models are not perfect, mentees will leave with practical skills in data science, a deeper appreciation for computational pathology, and experience contributing to a cutting-edge question: can we read cancer’s molecular blueprint directly from standard slides?

A note. There was a very similar study done a few years ago. But there are new and better publicly available datasets. Thus, the mentees will have a bit of a backbone to follow along and will help guide them.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32354610/,N/A,N/A,N/A,Yes,No,Yes

The Marcona deposit, Peru’s largest iron ore resource, is an IOCG-type system characterized by complex mineralogy and significant variability in ore grades. Shougang currently employs magnetic separation, but this method faces challenges in handling impurity-bearing sulfides and low-grade ores that are often discarded as waste.
The project investigates the potential of advanced SBOS technologies—such as X-ray transmission (XRT), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and hyperspectral imaging—to improve early-stage waste rejection, recover marginal ore, and enhance overall Fe grade control. By testing and comparing these methods, the study aims to determine whether SBOS can reduce energy consumption, improve resource recovery, and lower environmental impacts compared to traditional circuits.
This research is expected to provide the first academic case study on SBOS applications in a South American IOCG iron ore deposit. The findings will contribute both to industry practice and to the broader field of sustainable mineral processing by demonstrating how innovation can reduce waste and increase efficiency in large-scale operations.","Hello! I am a MASc student in Mining Engineering at UBC, and my research focuses on improving mineral processing efficiency in iron ore operations. Specifically, I study the comparative evaluation of traditional magnetic separation and sensor-based ore sorting (SBOS) at Shougang Hierro Perú’s Marcona deposit. This mine is the largest iron ore operation in Peru and presents a perfect case study due to its complex geology, variable ore grades, and reliance on magnetic separation as the main beneficiation method.
The project aims to test whether advanced SBOS technologies—such as X-ray transmission (XRT), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and hyperspectral imaging—can help reject waste earlier, recover marginal low-grade ores that are usually discarded, and reduce the overall energy and water consumption of the process. This is especially important in large-scale mining, where even small efficiency gains can have significant environmental and economic impacts.
For REX, I would like to guide mentees in a theoretical research project inspired by this work. Together, we will explore:
How traditional magnetic separation works and its limitations in complex deposits.
The principles of SBOS technologies and how they can be applied to iron ore.
The potential improvements in grade control, recovery, and sustainability when integrating SBOS into existing circuits.
Broader implications of adopting new technologies in mining, including environmental benefits and economic feasibility.
We will follow a structured timeline:
1. Introduction & Brainstorming – Discuss current challenges in mining and mineral processing.
2. Research Question Development – Define a clear question, such as “How can ore sorting improve iron ore recovery and reduce waste?”
3. Literature Review – Study existing academic papers and case studies on magnetic separation and SBOS.
4. Data Exploration – Analyze published data or hypothetical case scenarios to compare outcomes.
5. Analysis & Discussion – Develop arguments about the role of technology in sustainable mining.
6. Final Report/Presentation – Summarize findings in a concise, professional research format.
By the end of the project, mentees will gain a practical understanding of mineral processing, ore sorting technologies, and sustainability in mining, while also developing research skills such as critical analysis, data interpretation, and scientific communication.

For my MA thesis, Navigating the Education System and Related Services: Experiences of Newcomer Parents of Children with Special Needs, I explored how immigrant parents engage with education and healthcare systems in Canada. That study highlighted systemic barriers such as long waitlists, limited communication, and cultural differences, while also showing the persistence of parents as advocates for their children.

Building on this foundation, my PhD research investigates how culturally adapted social-emotional learning (SEL) practices can promote resilience and well-being among culturally diverse elementary students. Guided by Culturally Responsive Pedagogy and using narrative inquiry, I explore the lived experiences of educators and newcomer families to understand how cultural backgrounds shape perceptions of SEL and resilience.

Together, these projects aim to inform educators, schools, and policymakers on how to design more inclusive, culturally responsive approaches that support both families of children with special needs and immigrant students in general, ensuring that every child feels seen, supported, and empowered to thrive.

","As a current PhD student in Human Development, Learning, and Culture, I specialize in qualitative research methodologies, particularly narrative inquiry. My doctoral research focuses on culturally responsive approaches to social-emotional learning (SEL) and resilience-building in schools, and my master’s thesis explored the experiences of newcomer parents of children with special needs as they navigated education and healthcare systems in Canada. Drawing from this background, I would like to mentor undergraduate students in exploring education related research topics, particularly those connected to student well-being, equity, inclusion, and special needs education.

With my mentees, I envision developing a small-scale narrative inquiry or qualitative research project that helps them gain hands-on experience in the research process while also contributing to meaningful conversations in education. For instance, we might examine how students experience belonging in classroom communities, how teachers approach social-emotional learning, or how families perceive support systems in education. Alternatively, we could design a comparative literature-based project if students are more comfortable beginning with secondary research.

I would support my mentees in each step of the research journey, including:

Formulating a research question, narrowing a broad interest area into something specific and feasible.

Reviewing the literature, learning how to locate, evaluate, and synthesize relevant research articles.

Designing a methodology, introducing qualitative approaches such as interviews, observations, or narrative analysis, and considering ethical dimensions.

Collecting and analyzing data, practicing coding, identifying themes, and interpreting findings.

Knowledge mobilization, presenting results through a short paper, presentation, or even a creative format such as storytelling.

It has been noted we are in a post-truth era and unfortunately misinformation exists even in science. Furthermore, polarization of society is negatively impacting debate. Critical thinking, systems thinking, and thoughtful creative innovation can help combat such negative pressures on science. A phytobiome approach involves studying a plant as its own ecosystem or biome (plant, its associated organisms, and its environment). It also has complexity, including multiple hypothesis testing approaches, that can be missing in science literacy programming. We developed a new curriculum for phytobiome science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) kits. Our four phytobiome STEAM kits (preschool to grade 3, grade 4–7, grade 8–12, and adult) teach a phytobiome thinking approach using creative methods such as poetry, drawing, and so on, specifically in (i) hypothesis generation, (ii) study design, (iii) complexity in science, and (iv) STEAM reflection. We also use newly created (in another publication) plant, environments, associated organisms, and interactions model tables. To our knowledge, this is the first time phytobiome science literacy material has been created for such a wide range of ages and with incorporating the arts to help with inclusion and engagement, complexity, creativity, and critical thinking promotion. Our authorship team consists of students (high school and undergraduate), educators, and scientists, which in itself is a useful contribution, as we co-created the kits. The curriculum material and other information in this article can foster future studies.

Mathematically, the Dempster-Shafer approach represents evidence by assigning probabilities to sets (which is ambiguous) rather than points (which is always precise than realistically warranted). The full Dempster-Shafer approach is computationally expensive but ingenious approximation algorithms awaits explorations. Recent papers showed the Dempster-Shafer approach has good small sample properties. My doctoral thesis investigates robustness properties of the Dempster-Shafer approach to infer probabilistic graphical models under model misspecification theoretically and empirically with simulated and real world medical genetic datasets. When the observed data are scarce and the model is marked by a large number of variables that we know little about due to inapplicable scientific knowledge and low data quality, which is a typical setup when analyzing complex biological networks, using the Dempster-Shafer approach allows scientists to reduce costs associated with experimentation according to some less prudent decisions out of spurious statistical tests.

By participating the project students will acquire hands-on experience in modelling with probabilistic graphical models that has tangible real-world impact. As a result of the wide-ranging applications of the Dempster-Shafer theory, the skills developed through participation are highly transferrable to their key domain of interest, such as non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics and system biology. Students that are highly proficient in programming are encouraged to apply and contribute to the open-source software development and potentially co-authors to another paper. All students are encouraged to provide feedback to the training they received and those feedback will be taken to develop curriculums for future students.

Large scale epidemiological simulations. 
High performance computing.",Individual,Mix of both/depends on mentee preference,3,"I try to understand what happens when you drop learning agents into messy worlds. Most of my work so far has been on epidemics and locomotion, two problems that look simple on paper but collapse into chaos once you simulate them. In the epidemic case, I built a grid world where people move around, get infected, recover, and sometimes die. The challenge is figuring out if reinforcement learning agents can actually learn to avoid infection better than a hand-built heuristic. What I found is that reward design matters more than the algorithm. If you shape rewards wrong, agents learn clever but useless tricks, or they get worse with more training.

On the locomotion side, I’ve been working on humanoid agents that need to stand and walk. Here too, the key is reward shaping. I avoid negative rewards entirely, which forces me to think carefully about what “good” behavior means. I’m also exploring how diffusion models and generative priors might guide agents by giving them a sense of what plausible movement looks like.

The common thread is trying to see how far you can push learning in noisy, unpredictable environments and when a simple greedy strategy is actually better.","With mentees, I’d like to explore a theoretical–empirical project on experience replay in reinforcement learning. Most modern off-policy algorithms (DQN, SAC, TD3) rely on replay buffers to stabilize learning, yet we still don’t fully understand how the composition and sampling of experiences affect performance. The core question is: How does the way we use past experiences change the quality of the learned policy?

We could study this along several axes:

Temporal recency: What happens if agents overweight recent experiences versus sampling uniformly?

Prioritization: Does prioritizing surprising or high-error transitions always help, or can it destabilize?

Buffer pruning: What’s the effect of discarding certain categories of transitions (e.g., near-terminal states, highly stochastic outcomes)?

Cross-domain transfer: Are patterns consistent across structured tasks (like locomotion) and noisy tasks (like epidemic spread)?

The project timeline could look like this:

Month 1: Review key literature on experience replay and define experimental setups (simple gridworld + one continuous-control task).

Months 2–3: Run controlled experiments varying buffer usage (uniform, recency-biased, prioritized, filtered) while keeping algorithms fixed. Collect metrics on stability, convergence speed, and asymptotic performance.

Month 4: Analyze results to see if there are general principles (e.g., “recency bias helps in non-stationary tasks but hurts in stable ones”). Wrap up by framing findings as simple design guidelines.

The appeal of this project is that it connects theory and practice: mentees will gain intuition about why replay buffers matter, run actual experiments to see the effects, and reflect on when “more data” isn’t always better data. The broader lesson is to treat experience not as raw input, but as a resource to be curated.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01275,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236,"For context, I would like to add that I currently am revising a paper that is the usage of RL in epidemics context that actually leverages reward engineering and used to understand human behavior by using RL as a proxy and submitting to ICLR conference after getting some good feedback from NeurIPS.

I have a few project ideas in mind, but I am equally open to developing research questions tailored to a student’s interests, broadly within microbial ecology and evolution. 

Project 1: Microbiomes as individual “fingerprints.” This project will test whether animal microbiome profiles can be used to predict individual identity. Students would collect and work with publicly available longitudinal microbiome datasets and apply mathematical algorithms (adapted from methods developed in other research fields) to evaluate whether unique microbial “signatures” can consistently identify individuals over time. 

Project 2: Roles of specific bacterial taxa within the microbiome This project will explore how different bacterial taxa contribute to host microbiomes. Using the same  longitudinal microbiome datasets, students will develop methods to classify bacterial taxa along two complementary dimensions: Ecological role: generalists (common across many individuals) vs. specialists (unique to certain individuals). abundance dynamics: stable (consistent in relative abundance) vs. variable (fluctuating in relative abundance).  The aim is to identify how those dimensions intersect and what they reveal bacterial functions and their potential impact on host health. For example: Generalist + Stable: “core” taxa that may be essential for host health or function. Specialist + Stable: potential microbial “fingerprints” of individual hosts. Specialist + Variable: niche-sensitive taxa that may respond strongly to individual-level changes.

Overview. Membrane proteins (MPs) are essential for signaling, transport, and metabolic regulation, but their hydrophobic nature makes them difficult to study with mass spectrometry (MS). Membrane mimetic systems—such as Peptidisc, nanodiscs, and SMA Copolymers offer a way to stabilize MPs and expand their representation in proteomic datasets.

Mentees will explore how these approaches can highlight remodeling of transporters, channels, GPCRs, and other integral MPs in contexts such as neurodegeneration or metabolic disease. Emphasis will be placed on understanding which types of models benefit most from membrane mimetics and what kinds of results can be expected at both the protein and global pathway levels.

Optional directions. While the primary aim is to investigate MP dysregulation, mentees who wish to expand their focus may also explore:

Method development for membrane proteome profiling – testing how experimental design or sample preparation choices improve protein recovery, hydrophobicity coverage, capture of certain protein classes, or reproducibility.

Functional MS assays – evaluating ligand binding, thermal stability, or preserving native protein interactions when reconstituted with membrane mimetics.

RFBs work by using two liquid solutions of different redox potentials. Pumping the liquids into a reaction chamber, they react across a membrane, producing electricity. By applying a voltage, we can reverse the process, recharging the spent solutions. 

The membrane is a crucial component of the system, preventing the mixing of the two solutions while allowing ions to travel back and forth. The membranes, however, are not perfect. Over time, the solutions mix, reducing the capacity of the battery. The membranes also break down throughout operation, requiring replacement. Considering that the membrane is the most expensive component of the reaction chamber, frequent replacement in large-scale storage plants contributes to a large portion of maintenance costs.

I am investigating a potential interaction between two key proteins in the affected pathways: tissue factor, the main protein trigger of coagulation in the body, and the insulin receptor, which mediates insulin signalling throughout the body and is implicated in the insulin resistance seen in T2D. Tissue factor expressed in fat tissue could potentially present a new therapeutic target to reduce patients’ risk of thrombotic-related complications.","One of the biggest challenges in research is to be thrown into a field you may not much about and to piece together the current knowledge of the subject in order to propose relevant research projects. It can be difficult to figure out a valuable research question would be that both builds on what is already known while offering new insights into an underlying gap in the current literature. My goal as a mentor is to provide mentees with an opportunity of doing just this, within the fields of thrombosis and blood coagulation as it intersects with type 2 diabetes and other diseases. During the first month, students will select a topic for a literature under my review after some preliminary research and guidance. Over the next three months, I will meet biweekly with students during the completion of the review for discussion of specific papers, consultation on the writing and structure of the review. In the last two months, students have the option to draw on what they have learned from the review to propose a specific experiment to test a knowledge gap identified during readings. As before, I will be available to provide extensive feedback on proposed methodology and research design. Students will be able to present their review and proposal at MURC at the end.

These are rare tumours that start in the hormone-producing cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. They are challenging to manage because they vary a lot between patients, with similar appearing tumours using conventional methods responding differently to treatment. My research looks at ways to better understand their heterogeneity through approaches like molecular profiling, functional imaging (PET scans) and clinical studies, and pre-clinical models. The overall goal of my research is to improve precision medicine so that patients with GEP-NENs can receive more tailored and effective treatment.","I’m open to mentoring a variety of research project types, such as reviews, project proposals, or even trial designs in emerging areas. My current focus is on precision oncology for GEP-NENs, but the project we decide on does not have to be directly tied to my lab’s core work. Last year, for example, my mentees designed a pilot clinical trial for a new type of targeted therapy in GEP-NENs, which they presented as a poster at MURC.

In other words, I leverage computational resources such as varied datasets, annotations, and algorithms to describe, make inferences about, and model the behaviour of OC. The story of cancer and the phenomenon of mutations are closely intertwined; with most cancers having a cascade of mutations precipitating their development. Consequently, I currently study high-grade serous OC, the most aggressive subtype, as it displays an uncommonly aberrant mutational profile. The main datasets I use to study this disease come from the 'omics' umbrella: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc. Within this domain, my research asks questions about the mechanistic consequences of perturbing a cell's normally functioning pathways with mutations. To do this I borrow many techniques from the domain of machine learning as well as use bespoke methods for bioinformatics.","First, some base comments on scope. A student will be much more likely to find success in working with me if they arrive having done courses in statistics, computer science, and molecular biology. The more of each of these the better. A reasonable degree of comfort with at least one programming language would greatly help. Because of these points, higher-year students are preferred. That isn't to say that an enterprising junior year undergraduate couldn't also manage, but they would likely need to engage in a significant amount of supplementary reading/work. Motivation is also a key factor to consider. Research, even in a group project setting, involves a great deal individual work. So without a driving personal interest, it will be tough to self-motivate. Now the topics. I am interested in mentoring topics related to my research. I have linked two papers that I was involved in directly, and so an interest in topics related to either one of those papers would be a good match. More recently I have started playing with some epidemiologic-facing questions too, and relating these kinds of datasets to molecular features (example: publication #3). So an interest in that slant would also be welcome. Students that arrive with a specific hypothesis in mind are welcome! If you don't yet have a fully formed hypothesis, that's ok too, but in this case I would expect a few general questions to be on your mind - the two first publications I linked should elicit plenty and would be a great place to start.

Most patients receive a standard treatment regimen consisting of a combination of chemotherapy and drugs to suppress the immune system, however, ~40% of patients still do not respond to treatment. This is in part due to a high variability in the genetics and biology of cancerous B cells between patients. In recent years, DLBCL has been categorized into 7 subtypes based on distinct genetic characteristics. My research project focuses on one of these subtypes, called “BN2”, where I aim to uncover what drives the development of BN2 tumours. Previous studies found that BN2 tumours usually carry a genetic defect in a gene called TMEM30A, which we think dictates how these tumours behave. Currently, I am investigating how the loss of TMEM30A in normal B cells can affect their ability to respond to vaccination and produce antibodies. By understanding how TMEM30A loss affects normal B cell biology, we can gain insight on how cancerous B cells use this phenotype to thrive and cause aggressive disease.","I am open to different project ideas that are of interest to mentees.

My research explores the epigenomic and molecular foundations of neurodevelopmental syndromes and brain cancers. The central aim is to uncover how these disease states emerge—and how their underlying mechanisms might be reversed. To achieve this, we employ a multi-modal strategy that bridges experimental biology with computational analysis, integrating diverse omics technologies such as ChIP-seq, EM-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. These data are paired with experimental models using stem cells and cerebral organoids to recreate disease states in the lab. My primary role focuses on the computational dimension, where I synthesize these multi-modal datasets to reveal patterns of dysregulation that advance our understanding of brain development and disease.","I am primarily interested in leading a computationally focused project, as it only requires access to computers and does not depend on specialized lab equipment. That said, if mentees wish to explore projects that bridge the biological and computational sides of bioinformatics, I am open to developing something in that direction as well.

Two possible project ideas I have been considering are:

1. Bulk RNA-seq Deconvolution
Bulk RNA sequencing provides a powerful snapshot of the transcriptomic landscape within a biological sample (such as brain tissue). Yet, a long-standing challenge has been estimating the underlying cell-type composition from these complex data. While existing methods attempt to address this, many approaches—especially those not rooted in deep learning—struggle to fully capture the heterogeneity of bulk RNA-seq profiles. They also often underutilize the richness of modern reference atlases. A promising direction would be to design a hybrid or novel strategy that leverages these atlases more effectively, or alternatively, to build a unified platform that integrates multiple deconvolution methods into one accessible framework (Citation 1 and 2).

2. Reference Atlas Curation and Integration
Single-cell reference atlases have become essential tools for researchers across biology and bioinformatics, yet curating and integrating them remains difficult. Recent advances, such as Conditional Variational Autoencoders, have shown promise for reference-based integration. Extending these methods to the epigenomic space—or even to multi-modal atlas construction—would be a timely and impactful contribution. Such work could advance how scientists use and share reference data in their studies (Citation 3).

These ideas are suggestions to inspire mentees, and students are encouraged to refine or adapt them into projects that resonate with their own interests. Familiarity with programming (R, Python, Bash), version control (GitHub), and basic machine learning would be an asset, but I also welcome students with little or no prior experience—I am excited to teach these skills as part of the process. My goal is to guide mentees toward an engaging and practical project that could not only be deployed but also developed into a publishable contribution. I do, however, expect a strong commitment and willingness to put in the effort needed to make the project meaningful. We can discuss whether mentees desire to work on their own or in a group.

My project focuses on exploring the role of granzymes in immune-mediated diseases and their impact on shaping different immune responses.,"As a mentor, I would like the students to focus on understanding the role of granzymes in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Granzymes (granule-secreted enzymes) are a family of serine proteases, predominantly produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Based on recent research, they have been found to play more extracellular roles than just intracellular cytotoxic cell death. They are secreted by both immune and non-immune cells, and depending on the type of granzyme, their accumulation in the extracellular milieu might contribute to inflammation, tissue injury, impaired wound healing, barrier dysfunction, and/or autoantigen generation.
For this project, the students will conduct a literature review to identify unanswered biomedical research questions about the role of different granzymes (B, A, M, H, K) in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or Sjögren syndrome. Once the students have synthesized a research question, they will be guided in designing a methodology and experimental setup to address it. This will also include a focus on bioinformatics.
At the end, the literature review, along with the methodology, experimental setup, and predicted versus observed results, will be presented in the form of a poster at MURC or other conferences.

1) Develop a foundational understanding of implementation science. This is not a heavy, course-level workload, but rather a targeted exploration of seminal literature to build a shared vocabulary for our work. Following this, the mentee would identify a gap that may be ameliorated with an implementation intervention. Next a small-scale needs assessment to understand the current practice. This process will allow the mentee to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation intervention. This phase is intended to build qualitative research skills in interviewing and analysis.

2) After completing the assessment, findings will be mapped to an implementation framework. Based on the identified barriers and facilitators, the mentee would develop an implementation plan. This is the part of the project where theory is translated into action, allowing us to identify practical strategies to address barriers and leverage existing facilitators. 

3) In the final phase, the mentee could prepare and present a high-level summary of this process articulating the problem, the process of conducting a needs assessment, and the proposed implementation strategy.

How can individuals with the same condition present with drastically different symptoms? What can we do to treat human diseases? My research as a master’s student examines these broad questions in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath that insulates neurons. It is characterized by inflammation, demyelination, neuronal degeneration, and infiltration of self-reactive T cells into the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately manifesting with heterogenous symptoms such as paralysis, vision impairment, and cognitive changes. There is no definitive cause for MS, but certain infectious agents have been linked with this autoimmune disease. Infection with helminths (parasitic worms) has shown a protective role towards MS as evidenced by epidemiological, clinical, and preclinical mouse studies. My research aims to define the CNS-immune interactions that underlie delayed disease onset and enhanced recovery in a helminth infected mouse model of MS. Understanding how helminths remodel the neuroimmune landscape to dampen inflammation can inform the development of novel therapies for MS, which currently has no cure. ","PROJECT IDEAS: I have several ideas, though I would like to adapt these options based on individual interest. Regardless of the project, mentees will learn to identify a research question, formulate a testable hypothesis, and methodically collect data that yield interpretable results. One option is a scoping review. Potential topics include helminth immunotherapy in MS clinical trials, mechanisms of helminth immunomodulation, what characterizes age-related neuroinflammation, or anything that mentees have in mind regarding neuroinflammation. A scoping review is different from the qualitative summaries of literature that are commonly carried out for REX. Scoping reviews employ a systematic method of screening and analyzing studies. As part of this project, mentees will learn how to build a search strategy, define inclusion/exclusion criteria for study selection, carry out data extraction, interpret literature, and report findings per standard practice for this type of review. The final deliverable would be a presentation at the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC), and if appropriate, submitting a publication in an undergraduate journal. Another avenue we can explore would be analyzing imaging data or tying together clinical data with information on the exposome. This second research direction has its limitations. I currently do not have microscopy images available for analysis, and most publicly available datasets on MS are MRI images suited for segmentation. That said, this is one of the approaches that drew me towards science, and I am open to a more data analysis-focused project. 

MENTORSHIP & EXPECTATIONS: I aim to cultivate a collaborative environment where my mentees can pursue research questions at their highest potential.
